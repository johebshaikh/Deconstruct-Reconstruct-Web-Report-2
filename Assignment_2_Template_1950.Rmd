#### Code

The following code was used to fix the issues identified in the original. 

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
### Reading dataset
highest_paid_athlete<-read.csv("athletes1.csv")

# using trimws function to remove spacing or unnecessary tabs
highest_paid_athlete$Sport<-trimws(highest_paid_athlete$Sport)
highest_paid_athlete$Name<-trimws(highest_paid_athlete$Name)


### selecting top 20 highest paid athelete
hpa_1<-head(highest_paid_athlete,20)
str(hpa_1)


# changing column names for better understanding

names(hpa_1)[names(hpa_1) == "Rank"] <- "Rank_of_Players"
