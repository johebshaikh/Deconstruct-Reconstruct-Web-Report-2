**Objective**

In recent years sports personalities have gained a huge popularity not only in terms of their brand value but also in terms of money they get paid. The top-notch athletes who are paid big fat pay cheques mostly play sports like football, basketball, tennis. The original data visualisation tells us that their goal is to illustrate how these sportsmen from various sports have fared in terms of money theyâ€™ve earned in the year 2017. 

The original visualisation caters to the target audience of sports analysts on various news channels and newspapers to show how much these sportsmen are earning from various endorsements. Sponsors with these different sports leagues also get benefited with the stardom of the players and they can also be viewed as a target audience in this visualisation.

**The visualisation chosen had the following three main issues: -**

* In this graph the first issue is **visual bombardment**, we see there are lots of unnecessary data and visuals provided which make it difficult to visualise the graph easily. Also, in this data there are so many graphic cues that take away the attention from their intended audience. It can be seen in the visualisation that players face and information of them are irrelevant in the graph also graph includes grid line which makes difficult to read the earnings of the players. 

* The second issue is **poor colour scheme**,the data visualisation looks ambiguous and lacks clarification because the modulation of colour is not used very effectively. As we can see, identical colours are used, making the users hard to identify. For example, Beneath the graph, we could see several details that might cause a colour distinguishing issue to the audience.

* The third issue is **inaccurate selection of graph**, here  the choice of the data visualisation is very substandard. When we see those, who earn more have a wide circle while those who earn less have a tiny circle, we just could not differentiate whose incomes are more from the graph. Hence this visualisation is not self-explanatory.

#### Code

The following code was used to fix the issues identified in the original. 

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
### Reading dataset
highest_paid_athlete<-read.csv("athletes1.csv")

# using trimws function to remove spacing or unnecessary tabs
highest_paid_athlete$Sport<-trimws(highest_paid_athlete$Sport)
highest_paid_athlete$Name<-trimws(highest_paid_athlete$Name)


### selecting top 20 highest paid athelete
hpa_1<-head(highest_paid_athlete,20)
str(hpa_1)


# changing column names for better understanding

names(hpa_1)[names(hpa_1) == "Rank"] <- "Rank_of_Players" 
names(hpa_1)[names(hpa_1) == "Name"] <- "Name_of_Players" 
names(hpa_1)[names(hpa_1) == "X.Pay....mln."] <- "Payment" 
names(hpa_1)[names(hpa_1) == "Salary.Winnings....mln."] <- "Salary/winnings" 
names(hpa_1)[names(hpa_1) == "Endorsements....mln."] <- "Endorsements" 
names(hpa_1)[names(hpa_1) == "Sport"] <- "Sport" 

# created new column
hpa_1_new=hpa_1
hpa_1_new<-hpa_1%>%mutate(Percent_Earnings_from_endorsements= Endorsements/Payment*100)
hpa_1_new$Percent_Earnings_from_endorsements=round(hpa_1_new$Percent_Earnings_from_endorsements,0)
hpa_1_new

# plot
plot_bar<- ggplot(hpa_1_new,aes(x=reorder(Name_of_Players, Payment), y=Payment, fill= Sport)) +

#### Reconstruction

The following plot corrects the key problems with the original plot as the information are now in a horizontal bar chart. This data visualisation displays players overall profits in terms of the percentage profits from the endorsement. We can see players who don't earn much yet are profiting from endorsement. This means that players have to be recognised and have huge personalities in their competitions. So that they will gain endorsement even though the players are not in their great form.
